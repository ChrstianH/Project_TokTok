# TokTok

TokTok is a social media platform developed specifically for young professionals. It enables users to network, share content and be inspired.

## About this project

TokTok is the final project of our 6-month web developer bootcamp. In this project we were able to use our newly acquired skills in React, TypeScript and Supabase to develop a fully functional social media platform.

With a lot of joy and commitment, we realized the technical implementation of TokTok and learned a lot in the process. From planning and conception to development and deployment, we went through all the phases of a real project and were able to put our knowledge into practice.

We are particularly proud of the fact that we have created a mobile-first application that is specifically tailored to the needs of young professionals and successfully implements a given design.

## Vision

Although TokTok is already a fully functional social media platform, we would have liked to implement a few more ideas. <br>
Potential enhancements could be:

- **Replying to comments:** Allows users to reply directly to comments and thus structure discussions.
- **Messaging feature:** Allows users to send private messages to other users.

## Features

**Profile management:** Create and edit your profile with information about yourself and your professional interests.

**Create posts:** Share your thoughts, ideas and experiences in the form of image posts with text.

**Interact:** Respond to posts with likes and comments and exchange ideas with other users.

**Network:** Follow other users to see their posts in your feed and see who you follow and who follows you.

**Mobile-First:** TokTok is optimized for use on mobile devices and offers a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets.
